#XSLT local development

This project will allow you to transform XML files into html, using XSL.

To start run the command **npm install**

Then run **grunt dev** which will set up a local server on port 8080

The index.html is where you can add links to your views, which onload will call the javascript function that takes in your xsl file
and xml file.
